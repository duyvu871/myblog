# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements to the React framework. Let's explore what's new and how to get started.

## New Features in Next.js 15

### App Router Improvements

The App Router in Next.js 15 has been enhanced with:

- Better performance optimizations
- Improved streaming capabilities
- Enhanced error boundaries

### Server Components

Server Components are now more stable and offer:

```tsx
// Example Server Component
export default async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug);
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

### Turbopack Integration

Turbopack is now the default bundler for development:

- **Faster builds** - Up to 10x faster than Webpack
- **Better HMR** - Hot module replacement is nearly instantaneous
- **Improved caching** - Smart caching reduces rebuild times

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js 15 project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure

```
my-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ globals.css
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ next.config.js
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```
```ts title="useFetch.ts"
export const useFetch = () => {}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components by default** - They're more efficient
2. **Implement proper error boundaries** - Handle errors gracefully
3. **Optimize images** - Use the `next/image` component
4. **Follow the app directory structure** - Keep related files together

> **Tip**: Always test your application in production mode before deploying!

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 is a significant step forward in React development. The combination of Server Components, improved App Router, and Turbopack makes it an excellent choice for modern web applications.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
